## TODO

- [ ] Automatically load OSXFUSE device (load_osxfuse) if not found
- [ ] Re-mount if mount point is already mounted (or at least improve misleading error message: "operation not supported by device")
- [x] Check if mount point actually exists (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Unmount on application interrupt (currently unmounts but hangs)
- [ ] Add option to set volume name
